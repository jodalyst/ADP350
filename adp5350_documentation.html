# 6.08 PowBoard Documentation

## Rev. 0

The 6.08 Power Board is based around the <a href="http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADP5350.pdf" target="_blank">ADP5350 Battery Management Chip</a>.  It provides an I2C-based ability to control charging/discharging and regulation of a small-to-medium lithium-polymer battery, as well as the ability to route/control the power to up to three separate circuit blocks with independently-regulatable voltages using LDOs.

### Pin Descriptions

The ADP5350 has 32 pins (33 if you count its large contact electrode located on the underside).  We only need to break out a certain subset for our functionality:

* **5V:** USB voltage for the board
* **GND:** Electrical Ground for the board
* **SCL:** Serial Clock Pin for I2C communication (4.7kOhm pullup included)
* **SDA:** Serial Data Pin for I2C communication (4.7kOhm pullup included)
* **LDO1A:** LDO1 output (before sense resistor)
* **LDO1B:** LDO1 output (after sense resistor)
* **LDO2A:** LDO2 output (before sense resistor)
* **LDO2B:** LDO2 output (after sense resistor)
* **LDO3A:** LDO3 output (before sense resistor)
* **LDO3B:** LDO3 output (after sense resistor)



### Software



### Basic Operation

Instantiate a battery controller first and foremost.
